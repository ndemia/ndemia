## Hi, I'm Nicolás! 🙋‍♂️

I specialize in creating user-friendly interfaces that are accessible to everyone. I achieve this by connecting the dots between design and development, coding interfaces, performing cross-browser compatibility and accessibility tests. My background in design enables me to merge my technical expertise with a keen eye for detail, resulting in a user-centric approach.
