### Hi, I'm Nicolás! 🙋‍♂️

- 🍕 I’m currently working on a pizza app that helps me calculate and adapt my dough needs easily. It will also feature a list of pizza toppings for inspiration.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React and TypeScript. As well as JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Accessibility. One never stops learning, right?
- 👨‍💻 I’m looking for a job as a frontend developer where I can learn and grow.
- 💬 Ask me about pizza.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to keep my software updated. After days or weeks of being away, updating is the first thing I tend do when I get back.
